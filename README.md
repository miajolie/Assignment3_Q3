The Kotlin app consists of the following features:
- Build a contact list grouped alphabetically.
- Use stickyHeader to keep the current letter visible as the list scrolls.
- Provide at least 50 contacts (you may generate sample data).
- Add a “Scroll to Top” floating action button (FAB) that appears only when the user has scrolled past item 10.
- Use animateScrollToItem() with coroutines.

The App should display only these features once running. Once having scrolled, a scroll to the top button should appear, bringing you to the top
